Week 3 Log — CAP6415 F25
Period: Nov 17–Nov 23, 2025 

1) Synthetic data & training
- Generated SYN dataset with domain randomization (lighting, color jitter, scale, mild noise/occluders) under:
  data/synthetic/{brick,glass(or wood),concrete,metal,vegetation}
- Trained SYN-only and MIX (50/50) configurations; each run saves best checkpoint and validation metrics to:
  results/{syn|mix}/ and updates configs/eval.yaml → eval.checkpoint

2) NAT baseline carryover (context)
- NAT-only baseline from Week 2 remains our reference:
  Test (NAT): accuracy = 0.80, macro-F1 = 0.7333
- Confusion pattern (not addressed this week): vegetation ↔ concrete misclassifications.
  We note this and expect improvement as the NAT dataset is completed/cleaned.

3) Evaluation & comparisons
- Evaluated current best checkpoints on the held-out NAT test set (uniform protocol).
- Collected metrics/CMs under results/exp/eval and comparison CSVs (NAT vs SYN vs MIX) for reporting.
- Observation (qualitative): MIX appears more stable per-class than SYN-only; exact numbers will be finalized once NAT split is complete.

4) Grad-CAM 
- Implemented robust Grad-CAM over last conv (ResNet-18):
  src/gradcam.py → results/mix/cams/, results/nat/cams/, results/syn/cams/
- Qualitative findings:
  • Brick: attention on grout lines/joints and repetitive texture blocks.
  • Concrete: attention on pore/aggregate textures and edges.
  • Metal: attention on panel seams/mullions and scratches.
  • Vegetation: attention on leaf edges/high-frequency regions or to dark áreas, created by shadows.

5) TouchDesigner (real-time demo)
- Switched TD demo from dummy to real model outputs:
  • Sender: src/infer_td.py --mode model (from folder or webcam) → OSC JSON {label, confidence}
  • TD receive: OSC In DAT (port 8000) with callbacks Text DAT `oscin1_callbacks` (function onReceiveOSC)
  • State table: `cv_state` (label, confidence)
  • Visualization: Switch TOP (`material_switch`) driven by label mapping with a confidence gate (≥0.80) to reduce flicker.

6) Repo & code hygiene
- Consolidated src/train.py (supports NAT/SYN/MIX) with safe torch.amp usage and safe checkpoint loading.
- Fixed Grad-CAM dtype/shape issues
- infer_td.py now supports --mode {dummy,model}, --source_dir, and --camera (Camera usage was not implemented and finalized due to time restrictions); python-osc and opencv installed(In the computer and inside TouchDesigner, somehow is readed as different pythons)

7) Risks / notes
- Domain gap persists for certain conditions (e.g., low-texture concrete vs vegetation backgrounds). MIX training is the working mitigation.
- NAT dataset expansion in progress; we expect per-class F1 to stabilize once the split is fully populated and cleaned.

8) Next week (Week 4) — preliminary results plan
- Finalize NAT train/val/test splits (The quantity of the dataset was reduced and we opted for a quality over quantity approach with images form the internet).
- Re-train NAT/SYN/MIX on the fuller NAT split; lock best checkpoints.
- Record a 30–60s TD demo clip (real predictions) and add to results/.
